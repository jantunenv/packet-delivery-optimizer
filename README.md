# packet-delivery-optimizer
Hobby project. Aim is to essentially solve a traveling salesman problem combined with tightest packing problem. 
Starting from a list of different packages with their addresses. 
The aim is to optimize which packet goes to which car and find the best route for delivery.

Blender animation: example of the packing results. (Worked in VLC (ubuntu version) for me, not in some other players)
